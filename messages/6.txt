LaTeXTools Plugin version 2012-10-XX changelog:

New features:

- 


Bugs fixed:

- Robustified get_tex_root

- Cite completion: old-style edge case ("cite" without "_") invoked with old-
  style keybinding led to weird editor behavior. 

- Display error dialog if no bib file found, when cite completion is invoked
  using the new-style keybinding (can't do it for old-style keybindings).

- Display error dialog if ref/cite command cannot be properly dispatched 
  using the new-style keybindings; this is when the user enters "ref" or "cite"
  without "_".
