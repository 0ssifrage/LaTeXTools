LaTeXTools Plugin version 2012-11-05 changelog:

New features:

- Merged the new log parsing code; it should hopefully be much more robust, but let me know if you have
  any problems / crashes / hangs when compiling.


Bugs fixed:

- Robustified command and environment completion (C-l,c and C-l,e) so starred versions 
  of commands/environments are OK

- Robustified makePDF.py; now it should always fail gracefully when it cannot parse tex file names,
  and kindly ask the user to report the bug on GitHub :-) Note TODO: better filename regexp!

- Robustified support for MikTeX. I would say that right now both MiKTeX and TeXLive are equally
  well-supported on Windows.
